1. Thinking Level (New in Gemini 3)
What Changed

Gemini 2.5 used an implicit thinking_budget, where reasoning depth was controlled indirectly.

Gemini 3 replaces this with an explicit thinking_level parameter, allowing direct control over internal reasoning effort.

Thinking Levels Explained
Level	Availability	Technical Meaning	Best Used For
MINIMAL	Gemini 3 Flash only	Near-zero reasoning tokens; still enforces thought signatures	Simple, low-complexity tasks
LOW	Gemini 3	Reduced reasoning tokens	High-throughput, latency-sensitive tasks
MEDIUM	Gemini 3 Flash only	Balanced reasoning vs latency	Moderately complex tasks
HIGH	Gemini 3 Flash & Pro (default)	Maximum reasoning tokens	Multi-step planning, agents, complex logic
Technical Impact

Developers can now explicitly trade reasoning quality against latency and cost.

Reasoning behavior is predictable and reproducible, which is critical for production systems.

Even minimal reasoning still enforces thought signatures, improving tool-calling reliability.

2. Media Resolution Control (New in Gemini 3)
What Changed

Gemini 2.5 used fixed or opaque vision processing.

Gemini 3 introduces media_resolution, which directly controls how many vision tokens are allocated per image, PDF page, or video frame.

Resolution Levels and Token Budgets
Resolution	Image Tokens	Video Tokens	PDF Tokens
UNSPECIFIED (Default)	1120	70	560
LOW	280	70	280 + text
MEDIUM	560	70	560 + text
HIGH	1120	280	1120 + text
ULTRA_HIGH	2240	N/A	N/A
Key Technical Notes

Higher resolution = better fine-detail perception, but higher token usage and latency.

ULTRA_HIGH is image-only and must be set per media item.

PDFs are treated as vision inputs, and their tokens are now accounted under the IMAGE modality, not DOCUMENT.
